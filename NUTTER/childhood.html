        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in a supportive environment with my family and close friends.
            My childhood was full of learning about responsibility, respect, and hard work.
            Simple daily routines shaped my discipline and love for education.
        </p>

        <h2>School Life</h2>
        <p>
            Attending school at an early age sparked my curiosity and problem-solving abilities.
            I enjoyed exploring new ideas, participating in group activities, and learning from my teachers.
            These experiences laid the foundation for my later studies in software engineering.
        </p>

        <h2>Formative Experiences</h2>
        <p>
            Being involved in school events, community activities, and small personal projects
            strengthened my confidence and teamwork skills. These experiences helped me develop
            perseverance, creativity, and a strong motivation to grow academically and professionally.
