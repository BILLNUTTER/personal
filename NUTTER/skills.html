        </ul>

        <h2>Problem Solving & Analytical Skills</h2>
        <p>
            My background in mathematics and science has strengthened my ability to approach problems logically and
            systematically.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strong analytical thinking for breaking down complex problems into manageable solutions.</li>
            <li>Ability to debug code, identify errors, and improve system efficiency.</li>
            <li>Application of mathematical reasoning in computing and software logic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Collaboration & Communication</h2>
        <p>
            Software engineering involves teamwork and clear communication.
            I have developed interpersonal skills that support collaborative work.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work effectively in team-based projects and group assignments.</li>
            <li>Clearly communicate technical ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences.</li>
            <li>Learn, adapt, and accept feedback to improve performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I Can Do</h2>
        <p>
            With my current skills and ongoing training, I am capable of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designing and developing simple to intermediate websites and web applications.</li>
            <li>Assisting in software development projects and quickly learning new technologies.</li>
            <li>Applying programming knowledge to solve academic and real-life problems.</li>
            <li>Continuously improving technical skills through practice and self-learning.</li>
        </ul>
